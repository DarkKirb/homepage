Picking up where we left off last time, I’m currently in Pewter City and my goal is receiving the Cascade Badge in Cerulean City. Like last time I will start by planning out the route for the next 3 areas.

## Planning

The route to Cerulean City  passes through Routes 3 and 4, and Mt. Moon. Since Routes 3 and 4 share the same encounters, I will look at them together.

### Routes 3 and 4

The main Pokémon to catch here is {% pokemon Sandshrew %}, which appears with a 15% chance here. Additionally, {% pokemon Spearow %} are the most abundant here (55%), so if I hadn’t already caught them, I would now.

{% pokemon Sandshrew %}’s evolution {% pokemon Sandslash %} is available in the nearby Cerulean Cave, which is however not accessible until the post-game.

Additionally a {% pokemon Magikarp %} can be bought in the Pokémon Center on Route 4. While such a {% pokemon Magikarp %} can be caught anywhere with the Old Rod, it is easier to obtain it here, and doesn’t take up an extra inventory slot for such a useless item. That said, Magikarp is available with a Super Rod in Fuchsia City and the Safari Zone.

My plan is therefore to catch a {% pokemon Sandshrew %} and buy the {% pokemon Magikarp %}, all while training up my Pokémon. I need {% pokemon Mankey %} for the upcoming Hiker fights, {% pokemon Pikachu %} for the Cerulean Gym, and {% pokemon Metapod %} so that it can evolve.

### Mount Moon

Mount Moon offers 4 new Pokémon, that being {% pokemon Zubat %}, {% pokemon Geodude %}, {% pokemon Paras %}, and {% pokemon Clefairy %}. They have the most favorable encounter rates in B2F.

I will catch one of the first three, and three {% pokemon Clefairy %}. For the first three, their evolutions are available in the wild, and I need one {% pokemon Clefairy %} for {% pokemon Clefable %}, which we can use one of the two Moon Stones found here for, and one to trade for {% pokemon "Mr. Mime" %} on Route 2.

At the end of the cave, we have our choice between a {% pokemonItem dome-fossil %} Dome Fossil and a {% pokemonItem helix-fossil %} Helix Fossil. Since I already have {% pokemon Kabuto %} and {% pokemon Kabutops %}, I will choose the {% pokemonItem helix-fossil %} Helix Fossil here.

### Cerulean City

Cerulean City has an additional Pokémon to obtain, as a girl gifts you her {% pokemon Bulbasaur %} if your friendship with {% pokemon Pikachu %} is high enough. Since we do not yet have {% pokemon Venusaur %}, we need to train them up to Level 16.

Cerulean Gym is a water type gym and so we should not have any problems with our {% pokemon Pikachu %} to defeat it.

## The Journey

### Routes 3 and 4

These routes are mostly trainer battles and not very exiting. But it does remind me of a bit of trivia and hidden law that only exists in some localizations. In the German version, Youngster Ben (the “shorts are comfy and easy to wear” trainer) instead complains about wearing shorts because there are stinging nettles everywhere. Farther down the Route is Youngster Calvin (the {% pokemon Spearow %} youngster), and he’s proud of himself for telling his brother to wear shorts.

At the aforementioned {% pokemon Spearow %} youngster, my {% pokemon Metapod %} reached level 10 and evolved into {% pokemon Butterfree %}.

Luckily, my first encounter ended up being {% pokemon Sandshrew %}, which I had no problem catching, giving us Pokémon 50:
