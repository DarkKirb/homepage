This follows the [Advanced Sims 2 Legacy Rules](https://simslegacychallenge.com/legacy-challenge-rules/sims-2-legacy-challenge-rules-advanced/), with a few modifications:

- Mods are allowed, but they need to either make gameplay more difficult, not affect difficulty, or make the gameplay more realistic or detailed.
- I am allowed to move in or marry anyone, but I may not keep any funds from playables.
- The Sim receives the Legacy Lot for free, but they start out in uni with §500 and no §20,000 handouts on graduation.

I am also playing in an Uberhood, meaning that all lots and families from all Sims 2 neighborhood will exist and be accessible.

I am also playing with the following handicaps:

- Raccarchy[^1]
- One way street
- Aspiring to do it the hard way
- Free Roaming Ghosts
- Storyteller
- Danger Zone

[^1]: I want to keep the custom raccoon skin across the generations, but due to the way genetics work, past generation 2 there is only a 25% chance that the raccoon skin gene will be passed down, so it is actually more difficult than Matriarchy

This blog post series is the writing part of the Storyteller handicap.

I am also playing wtih [Lazyduchess’ Mod Story Progression](https://lazyduchess.tumblr.com/post/641754350169079808/story-progression-mod-open-beta), which I have modified slightly to be more verbose. Since it has no official public download link, [I have reuploaded the unmodified version I’m using here](Sims-2-Modded-Legacy-Challenge-Part-1-1/ldStoryProgressionBETA.zip). However keep in mind that his discord may have a newer version, so don’t go pester him about bugs in this version please.

The age durations are adjusted so that [1 day = 1 year](https://modthesims.info/d/627910/new-lifespan-1-day-1-year.html). For college I use cyjon’s mods that reduce semester durations to 1 day. As such, while university will still be slower than normal time, it is not 6x slower than normal time.

The reason why I will start with university is because of a mod called [“Edukashun Iz Gud”](http://cyjon.net/node/309), which limits the effective job level cap for uneducated Sims.

## Introducing: Charlotte

}
{% endimage %}

The founder is loosely based on my fursona and by extension myself. Charlotte is a knowledge Sim and is playful and nice.

After graduating from High School, Charlotte has gotten a spot in the coveted Académie le Tour. It has applied here because the Academy is known for their comprehensive and high quality humanities classes.

    "widths": [[576, 510], [768, 700], [992, 920], [1200, 1130], [1201, 1130]],
    "alt": "Charlotte Raccoon standing in front of Lam Plaza Dorms, thinking about Journalism"
}
{% endimage %}[^2]

[^2]: I have no idea why the thought bubble came out so muted.

Ever since it has become a teen, it has thought about becoming the next Media Magnate. And now, looking at the campus of Académie le Tour, this dream actually seems closer than ever. But Charlotte still has 4 years left before graduating and starting its career. It immediately declared its major and started working on the creativity skill it needs for graduating.

Other students moved in as Charlotte was practicing painting. After gaining a skill point, Charlotte started meeting its new dormmates.

    "widths": [[576, 510], [768, 700], [992, 920], [1200, 1130], [1201, 1130]],
    "alt": "Charlotte Raccoon talking with Mitchell Drake, a dormmate of Charlotte"
}
{% endimage %}

First there is Harry Freeman, which Charlotte first talked to, but the first impression was not good. However Mitchell Drake shares more interests with Charlotte.

Returning back to the unfinished painting downstairs, Charlotte quickly received a boost in its creativity skill, even though the canvas is still mostly blank.

Before its first class, Charlotte managed to gain a mechanical skill point. At class, it met Prof. Kerry Norton. Before going to bed, it studied some more mechanical skill and now reached 2/3 required skills.

    "widths": [[576, 510], [768, 700], [992, 920], [1200, 1130], [1201, 1130]],
    "alt": "Charlotte Raccoon reading a cookbook while watching cooking TV"
}
{% endimage %}

The following day Charlotte set out on a hunt to gain 2 cooking skill points without ever touching a single cooking utensil. I think it was successful despite the questionable means. But knowing that it is possible to learn cooking entirely from TV and books, Charlotte set eyes on its next goal: Getting on the Dean’s List

With the second day of college comes the first set of bills: They are §210, or around half of our entire money. Ouch.

    "alt": "Charlotte standing in front of a sofa with two other sims sitting on it. They are all watching television but Charlotte is blocking the view to the TV."
}
{% endimage %}

Both a cheerleader and the bad mascot visited the dorm today, but the cheerleader finds the gross antics of the cow man funny, although I think *Charlotte* may be the real bad mascot here, standing right in front of two Dormmates watching TV. There’s an empty couch right there, Charlotte!

Coming home from class today, Charlotte managed to max out its class performance meter, just in time for final exam tomorrow.

    "alt": "Cafeteria cook being extinguished by a sprinkler right above him"
}
{% endimage %}

The final exam went extremely well, with Charlotte finishing Sophomore year with an A+ and getting on the Deans List.
