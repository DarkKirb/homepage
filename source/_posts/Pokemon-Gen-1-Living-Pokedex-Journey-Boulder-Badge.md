As mentioned in the previous blog post, I am creating a Living Dex in Pokémon Yellow. Currently I possess a total of 40 Pokémon from previous games, but this number is of course going to increase starting now.

## Planning the Route

For encounter data I am mainly looking at [serebii.net](https://serebii.net). The site is not made for modern monitors, but it looks fine at above 160% magnification.

First, we need to plan out the route to Pewter City. Before receiving the Boulder Badge, the exit to Route 3 is blocked off. Similarly, we can’t proceed to Route 23 yet since we don’t have any Badges. Therefore we can catch Pokémon in the following locations:

### Route 1

Like in other Gen1 games, Route 1 consists entirely of {% pokemon Pidgey %} and {% pokemon Rattata %}. Unlike Red and Blue’s 50/50 split, {% pokemon Pidgey %} appear 70% of the time here however. I already caught {% pokemon Pidgey %} and there is a better encounter rate for {% pokemon Rattata %} on Route 2, so this Route is only good to train {% pokemon Pikachu %}.

### Route 22

Route 22 offers a great variety of Pokémon this early on, with 35% {% pokemon Nidoran♂ %}, 25% {% pokemon Nidoran♀ %}, 20% {% pokemon Mankey %}, 10% {% pokemon Rattata %}, and 10% {% pokemon Spearow %}.

Most important here is the {% pokemon Mankey %} of course, since it is the only Pokémon that has a very effective attack on Brock’s Pokémon in the early game (Before water or grass Pokémon become available). It is therefore important to obtain it here. It learns Low Kick at level 9, and it’s a good idea to get past that for Brock anyways. The alternative to training up {% pokemon Mankey %} is using {% pokemon Lapras %}, which doesn’t yet obey without the Cascade Badge.

{% pokemon Nidoran♀ %} is more readily available on Route 9, and {% pokemon Spearow %} is far more common on Routes 3 and 4, and so I will not block the hunt on these Pokémon (although it is likely I get at least one of them).

Another Pokémon of note here is {% pokemon Poliwhirl %}, which requires the Super Rod to acquire. It is only available here and on Route 23, but more common there.

### Route 2

Route 2 only offers Pokémon we have seen before. 40% {% pokemon Rattata %}, 30% {% pokemon Pidgey %}, 15% {% pokemon Nidoran♂ %}, 15% {% pokemon Nidoran♀ %}.

It is the best place to catch {% pokemon Rattata %}.

We have to go back here after receiving Cut to trade a {% pokemon Clefairy %} for a {% pokemon "Mr. Mime" %}.

### Viridian Forest

Unlike Red and Blue, Viridian Forest is the only place {% pokemon Caterpie %} (55%) and {% pokemon Weedle %} (20%) appear. Unlike those games, {% pokemon Pidgey %} (24%) and {% pokemon Pidgeotto %} (1%) appear there too, although of course Route 15 is the best Route to get the latter.

We need to get a {% pokemon Caterpie %} and a {% pokemon Weedle %} here, as well as another one of them at the highest level possible (6) for {% pokemon Butterfree %}.

### Pewter City

The one Pokémon of note here is the Old Amber, which can be revived into {% pokemon Aerodactyl %} on Cinnabar Island. However we are not able to receive it yet, since we need Cut to receive the item from a scientist in the Museum.

## The Journey

As always in Pokémon Yellow, I start out in Palette Town and receive my starter {% pokemon Pikachu %} as the only option. Unfortunately, I failed to defeat the rival’s {% pokemon Eevee %}, and so I’m left at Level 5 with a {% pokemon Pikachu %} that hates me. Leaving Palette Town, I first need to do a fetch quest for Oak’s Parcel before I receive the Pokédex and can start catching Pokémon.

Having unlocked catching and trading, now is as good a time as any to transfer over all of the Pokémon from the previous games. To significantly speed this process up (I would have to catch 40 Pokémon and then trade them over one by one), I decided to use PKHeX to move all of them over, and then manually performed the evolutions in the editor as well.

Before I started catching Pokémon I leveled up my {% pokemon Pikachu %} a bit, up to level 7. Then I headed out to Route 22 where the real journey began.

### Route 22

Route 22 treated me extremely well. It gave me all Pokémon I needed or wanted in rapid succession.

The first Pokémon I encountered on that route was {% pokemon Spearow %}, however due to its low level and {% pokemon Pikachu %}’s only attacking move being Thundershock, I needed to use {% pokemonItem poke-ball %} Pokéballs at max HP. This only took two tries, giving me my 42nd Pokémon:

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/spearow.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "The pokédex page for Spearow, the Tiny Bird Pokémon. It is 1ft tall and 4lb heavy. Inept at flying high. However, it can fly around very fast to protect its territory",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

Since {% pokemon Fearow %} is readily accessible on Route 17, I do not need to train this Pokémon up.

Shortly after I encounter the {% pokemon Mankey %} I was looking for and catch it on the second try after reducing it to 1hp ( {% pokemonItem poke-ball %} Pokéball odds stop increasing after 1/3 health but {% pokemon Pikachu %} was too strong to hit 1/3).

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/mankey.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Mankey, the Pig Monkey Pokémon. It is 1ft8in tall and 62lb heavy. An agile pokémon that lives in trees. It angers easily and will not hesitate to attack anything.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

{% pokemon Primeape %}, as well as {% pokemon Mankey %} above the evolution level are available on Route 23, so I only need to train it for Brock.

Directly afterwards I encountered a {% pokemon Nidoran♀ %}, which i quickly caught:

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/nidoran-f.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Nidoran♀, the Poison Pin Pokémon. It is 1ft4in tall and 15lb heavy. A mild-mannered Pokémon that does not like to fight. Beware, its small horn secrete venom.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

{% pokemon Nidorina %} are available on Route 23, so I do not need to train this Pokémon up either.

And, as luck would have it, I received a {% pokemon Nidoran♂ %} right afterwards, for which I use my {% pokemon Spearow %} and {% pokemon Nidoran♀ %} to weaken it.

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/nidoran-m.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Nidoran♂, the Poison Pin Pokémon. It is 1ft8in tall and 20lb heavy. Its large ears are always kept upright. If it senses danger, it will attack with a poisonous sting.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

Like {% pokemon Nidorina %}, {% pokemon Nidorino %} is available on Route 23, so we do not need to train it.

With that, I have caught all of the Pokémon I want from Route 22 and we can move on.

### Route 2

Before I catch more Pokémon, I first deposited all of the Pokémon I just caught into Box 2, sans the {% pokemon Mankey %}.

The hunt for the {% pokemon Rattata %} was of course very quick, and after just one encounter I was able to add the 46th Pokémon to the ‘Dex:

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/rattata.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Rattata the Rat Pokémon. It is 1ft tall and 8lb heavy. Will chew with anything on its fangs. If you see one, it is certain that 40 more live in the area.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

{% pokemon Raticate %} is available in Pokémon Mansion most frequently, so we also don’t need to worry about training it up.

Before entering Viridian Forest, I decided to train {% pokemon Mankey %} a bit here for Viridian Forest, and placed Rattata into Box 1, where it will stay for the rest of the run.

### Viridian Forest

Viridian Forest is the first place with Trainer Battles. I’ll primarily update on major trainer battles here, such as Rival Fights, Gym Leaders, Giovanni, etc. There are Pokémon to catch here too, so let’s get going. Naturally, the first encounter on the route is {% pokemon Caterpie %}:

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/caterpie.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Caterpie, the Worm pokémon. It is 1ft tall and 6lb heavy. If you touch the feeler on top of its head, it will release a horrible stink to protect itself.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

After 2 encounters, I find the next Pokémon I need, {% pokemon Metapod %}:

{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/metapod.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Pokédex Entry of Metapod, the Cocoon pokémon. It is 2ft4in tall and 22lb heavy. Hardens its shell to protect itself. However, a large impact may cause it to pop out of its shell.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

{% pokemon Butterfree %} is not found in the wild, and so we need another one of them to evolve into {% pokemon Butterfree %}. For that, one of the Level 6 encounters is most appropriate, as {% pokemon Metapod %} evolves into {% pokemon Butterfree %} at level 10.


{% image Pokemon-Gen-1-Living-Pokedex-Journey-Boulder-Badge/viridian-forest.webp %}
{
    "widths": [[768, 320], [769, 640]],
    "alt": "Viridian Forest in-game. There are numerous trees and a grassy path and a not grassy path. In the middle is the main character, their Pikachu, and below that is another trainer.",
    "pixelArt": true
}
{% endimage %}

One tip for catching Pokémon in Viridian Forest is to avoid the grass tiles with a flower in the bottom right corner. These will never result in encounters, so if you want those avoid these tiles.

After 5 encounters, I find the level 6 {% pokemon Caterpie %} i was looking for. Unfortunately, due to a crit I defeated it instead of catching it. So the search goes on.

On the second to last trainer, I leveled {% pokemon Mankey %} up to Level 9, at which point it learned Low Kick.

Three encounters later I did find a level 6 {% pokemon Metapod %}, and I caught it after 2 {% pokemonItem poke-ball %} Pokéballs.

### Pewter City

With all of the catching done, it is time to tackle Brock. My lead {% pokemon Mankey %} is Level 10 after the gym trainer fight.

Brock starts out with his lead {% pokemon Geodude %}, which falls to two Low Kicks. He then sends out his ace {% pokemon Onix %}, which fell similarly after 3 Low Kicks. He also didn’t cause {% pokemon Mankey %} damage thanks to a flinch, a missed Screech, and a Bide.

And with that we are done with this article! I caught 8 Pokémon here and increased my Pokédex total to 48 (31.8%). The next post will be about the Cascade Badge, and Route 3, Mount Moon, and Route 4.
